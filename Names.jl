#The aim of this part is to understand the use of variables and functions.

#In julia, variable name is also called an identifier. An identifier may
#include any upper, lower letters, any digit, one underscore_ and one exclamation!
#But the first character in an identifier cannot be a digit or !.
#In addition, any Unicode characters can be used in a variable name:
Î±7= 0.7
escape_velocity=9.8

#A variable name with only of underscore_, can be a assigned a value and
#discarded immediately and cannot be used in subsequent expression.

#another special variable is ans, which takes the value of the most recent result
# in a REPL. For example:
8+3
x = 3+ans
